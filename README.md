# MinimalRobot
## About
In this repository I attempt to build a minimalistic robot car. The robot will mostly be printed with a 3D printer and controlled by a NodeMCU (C++).

This is a hobby project. There is no money, no work related stuff, just fun while creating my own robot car. So if anyone wants to contribute, feel free to give me a message.

## Milestones
- [x] 10.05.18 Start the project on GitHub
- [x] 10.05.18 First connection from controller to PC
