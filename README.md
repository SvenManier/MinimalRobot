# MinimalRobot
## About
In this repository I attempt to build a minimalistic robot car with some sensors so it can interact with it's surrounding world. The robot will mostly be printed with a 3D printer and controlled by a microcontroller.

This is a hobby project. There is no money, no work related stuff (though it's related to my thesis, but isn't part of it), just fun while creating my own robot car to play with. 

After I reached my first target of building an interacting robot car, my next (and last) goal is to build a small swarm out of them and let them interact with each other to simulate a swarm of animals.

## (Current) Milestones
- [x] 10.05.18 Start the project on GitHub
- [x] 10.05.18 First connection from controller to PC
- [ ] Designing the entire car
- [ ] Printing the entire car
- [ ] Robot car can drive straight forward
- [ ] Robot car can drive simple formations (like 90Â°)

## Overview
- I'm using a NodeMCU (https://www.az-delivery.de/products/nodemcu) to control the robot car
- The software is written in C/C++
  - I'm using the Arduino IDE. Maybe I'll switch to Eclipse or CLion later, don't know yet
- The parts of the robot are mostly printed with a 3D printer (Prusa i3 in my case)
  - I may use other parts if I have no other choice, but im trying to print as much as possible
